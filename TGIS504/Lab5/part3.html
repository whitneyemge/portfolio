      <h1>COVID-19 fatality rates</h1>
      <h2>As reported on March 4, 2020</h2>

      <canvas id="barChart" width="1600" height="900"></canvas>

      <p>This chart shows the mortality rate for COVID-19 in nine countries. At first look it appears that the mortality rate in the U.S. is higher, however, that does not mean that the disease is more deadly in the U.S. The U.S. is testing fewer people for COVID-19 than other countries, and since mortality rate is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases, the mortality rate might seem to be higher in the U.S. than in other countries because there are fewer known cases in the U.S. to divide by.</p>
